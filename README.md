# The 808ers Club Drum Machine
Welcome to the 808er's Club!
This is the Arduino code for the drum machine. It utilizes the Adafruit Pro Trinket Keyboard library (https://learn.adafruit.com/pro-trinket-keyboard/library). Each pin triggers a key to be pressed. The keypress prints to the serial monitor. The sketch is to be used with this Scratch sketch: http://tiny.cc/808ersclubdrum.
